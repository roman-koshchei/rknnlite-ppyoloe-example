# RKNN PP-YOLOE Example

Official python example from [rknn_model_zoo](https://github.com/airockchip/rknn_model_zoo/tree/main/examples/ppyoloe) separated into own small repository to easily run to test inference.

Core code isn't changed, but only RKNN executor is included and other executors are removed.

Create `media` folder and put images into it.
